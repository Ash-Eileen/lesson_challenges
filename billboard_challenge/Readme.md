# Class Inheritance with Songs, Artists, Albums and BillboardTop10 Classes

This challenge was quite similar to the vehicles challenge, however, there were more checks in place for this. I commented out some of my own checks along the way that were designed to see how my code was working.

This was really enjoyable as I got to present to the class and was able to explain step-by-step what everything did and used my commented out code to demonstrate this as well.
